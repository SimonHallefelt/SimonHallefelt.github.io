                        <h3>Service Robotics</h3>
                        <p>
                            Built, designed and programmed a robot that is capable of 
                            to navigating a labyrinth, locate objects within it (cylinders), and 
                            carry them out of the labyrinth while meeting time constraints.

                        <p>
                            The robot’s brain was an <b>Arduino</b> programmed in <b>C++</b>.
                            Ultrasonic and reflectivity sensors were utilized for navigation.
                            The wooden components were designed using <b>SolidWorks</b> and cutout using a laser cutter.

                                Designed and programmed an <b>SQL</b> database for a fictional cookie factory. 
                                The project involved creating a robust system to manage various aspects of the factory, 
                                including multiple recipes, ingredients, customers, and transportation logistics. 
                                Additionally, SQL queries were developed to automate key processes, 
                                such as checking inventory levels to ensure sufficient ingredients for 
                                fulfilling orders, among other functionalities.

                                This is an Othello game built with <b>C++</b>, featuring <b>Raylib</b> for its graphical user interface. 
                                The game supports three distinct types of players: a manual player, a 
                                random player, and a smart player that uses alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move. 
                                <br> 
                                The project is built using <b>CMake</b> and utilizes <b>vcpkg</b> to manage the Raylib library. 
                                Both the GUI and game logic run on separate threads, sharing the GameInfo class through a 
                                smart pointer (<b>shared_ptr</b>).

                                This is a Connect-4 game featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) and five player types: human, random, bot, bit bot (easy), and bit bot (hard). 
                                The game is developed in <b>Rust</b> and utilizes <b>Slint</b> to create the GUI. 
                                The bit bot (hard) employs both alpha-beta pruning and bit boards to determine the best move.
